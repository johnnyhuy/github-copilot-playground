# GitHub Copilot Playground

This repository is a playground for exploring and demonstrating the capabilities of GitHub Copilot with various programming languages and frameworks, including Java, .NET, React, and NodeJS.

## Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each representing a different language or framework:

- [`playground/dotnet/`](./playground/dotnet/): Contains .NET projects, including a FlappyBird game and a Playground project.
- [`playground/java/`](./playground/java/): Contains a Java project that implements the Fibonacci sequence.
- [`playground/python/`](./playground/python/): Contains Python scripts, including a donut animation and a playground script.
- [`playground/react/`](./playground/react/): Contains a React application.

## Usage

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and navigate into the directory of the language or framework you're interested in.

### .NET
